The goal of this project was to demonstrate our understanding of the basic html commands. I did this by making a food blog, detailing three recipes, the ingredients needed, and how to cook them following the recipe. Throughout this project, I demonstrated my understanding of headers, unordered & ordered lists, images, and links. I also demonstrated my understanding of the boilerplate template for all HTML files.
