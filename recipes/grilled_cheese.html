            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a twist on the classic grilled cheese, and I must say,
                this is one of the best I've ever had! This easy recipe has 
                a crispy parmesan crust, a gooey cheddar and a bacon filling.
                Despite the simple exterior, the flavors here are killer, and
                goes great with a tomato soup, if you have one! Takes about 15
                minutes, so not much of a time commitment to make this one either!
